## Overview
We will be using data exploring the quality and physicochemical characteristics of Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. These data come from a paper published by Cortez, et al. in Decision Support Systems in 2009. The purpose of this project is predicting the quality of the wine based on physicochemical characteristics.

* Utilizing machine learning techniques including random forest, decision tree and logistic regression.
* Measuring which model is more suitable for this dataset.
* Trying to do variable selection in order to simplify model.
